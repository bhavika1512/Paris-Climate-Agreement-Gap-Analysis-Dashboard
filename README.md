Paris Climate Agreement Implementation Gap Dashboard üåç
This project presents an interactive data visualization dashboard analyzing the gap between national climate pledges under the Paris Agreement and actual global CO‚ÇÇ emissions. The platform enables users to explore trends, assess policy effectiveness, and identify critical sectors and regions needing focused climate action.

Project Highlights
Tracks global CO‚ÇÇ emissions trajectories compared to Paris Agreement targets
Assesses policy effectiveness using clear visual metrics
Analyzes carbon intensity (CO‚ÇÇ/GDP) to understand the economic-emissions relationship
Identifies key sectors and regions requiring targeted intervention for emissions reduction

Key Insights
In 2021, global CO‚ÇÇ emissions reached 37,123.85 Mt, pushing warming projections to approximately 2.7¬∞C, exceeding the goals set by the Paris Agreement.

Technologies Used
